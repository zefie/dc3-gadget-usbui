---------------------------

NeoMPC is a web based MPD Client which is designed for a small screen device
with a web browser, like a PDA or a mobile phone (although it’s taylored
specifically for a screen 320 pixels wide, I might change it in the future to
be a little more flexible).

You’ll need to be running Apache, Apache2 or Lighttpd (recommended) with
PHP 4.3 or greater on your MPD server. Running it should be as simple as
extracting it to the apache directory (or other web server accessible directory)
and navigating to it with your browser.
